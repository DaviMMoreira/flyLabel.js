# FloatLabel

An implementation of [Matt Smith's float label
concept](http://mattdsmith.com/float-label-pattern/).

The goal of this plugin is not to look like the original concept. In fact, the
goal is not to look like anything at all. The style, transitions, and
animations are all determined by CSS. There are several examples in the
[demo](http://athaeryn.github.io/floatLabel).
